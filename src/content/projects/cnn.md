## ðŸ™Œ Introduction

Orchid plants exhibit diverse characteristics that make their classification challenging. This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to classify orchids using a majority voting approach. The models used in this study include:
- **Baseline CNN**
- **Xception**
- **NASNet Mobile**

## Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Classification**: Utilizes CNN architectures to classify orchid species.
- **Majority Voting Strategy**: Combines outputs from multiple models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- **Pretrained Models Support**: Incorporates transfer learning for better feature extraction.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Implements image augmentation and normalization for improved model generalization.
- **Scalable Implementation**: Easily adaptable for different plant classification tasks.
